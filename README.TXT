PROJECT TITLE: CSIS 10B - Final Project - Evil Hangman
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A game of hangman where the computer cheats
VERSION or DATE: Spring 2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Execute EvilHangManMain's void main(String []args) 
AUTHORS: Yvonne Cruz


I made an evil hangman game that cheats by not sticking to one word from 
the beginning. I used the Dictionary and ArrayList classes to help me store
the word list families and words, respectively. I used a few methods in the 
main class to help find the key with the largest word family, check to see if 
input of the guesses letter was a letter, and to find the pattern that certain
guessed letters made and turn it into a key to use in the Dictionary.
